This project looks into the medical research experiments of various drugs on mice. The tools used are pandas and scipy

With the help of various statictical tools including correlation and regression the relationship between the drugs that are administered to the mice is checked against the amount of tumor.

Following are the statistical observations:

1. During the trials nearly equal number of male and female mice were used . This is good as it removes any bais that may occur due to gender during trails
2. Maximum mice were administered the drugs Capmulin and Ramicane
3. The heavier mice are prone to more tumor as there is a strong positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the volume of the tumor. for every 1 gm increase in the weight of the mouse there is nearly 1 mm3 increase of tumor volume
